## Quick start

![summary](/assets/summary.gif)

## Setup

**CLI Tool**
<br />
Make sure you already have NodeJS + NPM installed. To run `sendchamp-simulator`, it's as simple as doing an `npx` which means running the latest version available on npmjs.com.

```bash
npx sendchamp-simulator --phone=2349153207998
```

As seen in the above command, you need to specify a number for the simulator to receive text messages on. That doesn't mean you cannot run multiple simulators with different numbers. Of course you can !

<br />

```bash
[5/27/2022, 11:59:40 PM] Simulator started on http://localhost:2920/?phone=2349153207998
```

‚òùÔ∏è You'll see a similar url printed on your console after running the command from before.

<br />

So you have another number right ? Create a new browser tab copy and paste this url there, and you get a simulator for this number. Create a new tab again üôÉ. Paste the url again, but this time replace the phone number in the url.

<br />

For example: You want to run a simulator for both numbers **2348123775374** and **2349153207998**.
After starting the simulator: Go to your browser and open two tabs with the urls:

- http://localhost:2920/?phone=2348123775374
- http://localhost:2920/?phone=2349153207998

üëè Yes !. You now have two simulators ready to receive messages.

You see that green dot at the top right edge of the simulator ? If it's not green means your simulator isn't connected. Either you need to reload the page or restart your simulator ! Please don't use old browsers like Internet Explorer for this simulator or I would come for you üò†.

<br />

## Lets gooo

Now that we have the simulator setup, It's time for us to start developing our app using the sendchamp api. I said sendchamp api right ü§î. Not really. This simulator is more like a proxy to the sendchamp API and intercepts endpoints like the /sms/send, /verification/create , etc. So you won't have to spend a dime when testing your sendchamp integrated apps.

<br />

Ideally you would have a constant holding the sendchamp api base url before making api calls in your app. So you can dynamically change this url based on your app environment. Let's see what I am talking about below.

<br />

## Examples
Pardon me üôè, I only know how to write nodejs and golang fluently.

**Nodejs with axios**
```javascript
// use simulator url if in dev mode and live url in production
const axios = require("axios");

const BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "http://localhost:2920" : "https://api.sendchamp.com";

// Now lets start attacking the endpoints.
// Lets send a text message to one of our simulators phone number.

let options = {
  to: "2349153207998",
  message: "Pinging my simulator",
  sender_name: "Sendchamp",
  route: "dnd"
};

axios.post("/api/v1/sms/send", options, {
  baseURL: BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    // this doesn't neccessarily need to be a valid key.. anything works üòú. but if you want to use other endpoints like /wallet/wallet_balance you need to put a valid sendchamp public key, since those endpoints aren't intercepted and they go directly to api.sendchamp.com. 
    "Authorization": "Bearer <sendchamp_key>",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}).then((response) => {
  // exactly as sendchamp would respond you üòâ
  console.log(response);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

Now, let's check the simulator !.

And also in the console, we get the regular sendchamp response.

**Nodejs with [sendchamp-sdk](https://github.com/fuadop/sendchamp-sdk)**

```javascript
const Sendchamp = require("sendchamp-sdk");

const sendchamp = new Sendchamp({
  publicKey: "sk_test_$lkdl$lksd...",
  mode: "local-simulator"
});

const sms = sendchamp.SMS;

const options = {
  sender_name: "sendchamp.sdk",
  to: "2349153207998",
  message: "test from sendchamp-sdk",
  route: "dnd"
};

sms.send(options)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

**Golang with [sendchamp go sdk](https://github.com/fuadop/sendchamp)**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/fuadop/sendchamp"
)

var publicKey string = "your-public-key"

var mode string = sendchamp.ModeLocalSimulator

func main() {
	client := sendchamp.NewClient(publicKey, mode)
	sender := "sendchamp"
	to := []string{"2349153207998"}
	message := "my sms message"
	route := sendchamp.RouteInternational

	res, err := client.NewSms().Send(sender, to, message, route)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(res)
}
```

**Golang with net/http**

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	url := "https://api.sendchamp.com/api/v1/sms/send"

	if env := os.Getenv("GO_ENV"); env == "development" {
		url = "http://localhost:2920/api/v1/sms/send"
	}

	type SendSMSPayload struct {
		To         []string `json:"to"`
		Message    string   `json:"message"`
		SenderName string   `json:"sender_name"`
		Route      string   `json:"route"`
	}

	sp := SendSMSPayload{
		To:         []string{"2349153207998"},
		Message:    "Lorem ipsum d, no lele",
		SenderName: "Dash",
		Route:      "non_dnd",
	}

	j, _ := json.Marshal(sp)
	payload := bytes.NewReader(j)

	req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", url, payload)

	req.Header.Add("Accept", "application/json")
	req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer ACCESS_KEY")

	res, e := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

	if e != nil {
		log.Fatal(e)
	}

	defer res.Body.Close()
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

	fmt.Println(res)
	fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

## Notes

The following endpoints communicate with the simulator:

- "/api/v1/sms/send"
- "/api/v1/verification/create"

Yes, sms OTPs would get received by the emulator and you can use the "/api/v1/verification/confirm" endpoint to verify it.
If the channel set in the "/api/v1/verification/create" body is not "sms" the request is processed by "api.sendchamp.com".

<br />

All other endpoints not listed above are all processed by "api.sendchamp.com". Your local simulator is a proxy ‚úÖ.

## Timeline

Currently the simulator works for all sms based requests. I am looking into also intercept the voice based requests to the simulator, if that would be necessary.
